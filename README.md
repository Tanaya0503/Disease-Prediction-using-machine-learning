# Disease-Prediction-using-machine-learning
This Machine Learning project is used to predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user.It predicts using three different machine learning algorithms.So,the output is accurate.It uses tkinter for GUI.
The purpose of this system is to provide prediction for the general and more commonly occurring disease that when unchecked can turn into fatal disease. The system applies data mining techniques and decision tree algorithms. This system will predict the most possible disease based on the given symptoms and measures required to avoid the aggression of disease, it will also help the doctors analyse the pattern of presence of
diseases in the society. In this project, the disease prediction system will carry out data mining in its preliminary stages, the system will be trained using machine learning and data mining.

Python Libraries that would be need to achieve the task:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sci-kit Learn
4. Tkinter
